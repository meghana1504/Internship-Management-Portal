						<h2>Why Internships ?</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Internships are a great way for college students, recent graduates or anyone considering a career change to obtain valuable work experience.  Some students begin college with a major or career path in mind, and end up changing their minds later on. Taking on an internship while in college allows students to work in their desired field, helping them decide if the field is right for them.</p>

							<p>Internships allow for feedback from supervisors and others who are established in the field, and offer a unique learning opportunity that you may not have again as a working adult. Embrace the mistakes you make as an intern and the many things that you wonâ€™t know. Ask questions, observe, and take risks to get the most out of your internship training experience.</p>

							<p>The Internship is paid which means you can gain valuable work experience and make money at the same time. Being self dependent boosts one's self-confidence.This helps because it'll help get you started on a life time of reassurance. </p>
